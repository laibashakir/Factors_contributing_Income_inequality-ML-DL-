# Factors_contributing_Income_inequality_Pakistan-ML-DL-
Income inequality has been a persistent issue in Pakistan, despite its economic growth in
recent years. This brief report highlights the main trends and factors contributing to income
inequality in the country using data up to 2021, Using different Machine learning and Deep learning models.

**Key Findings:**
A measure of income inequality known as the Gini coefficient has revealed that
Pakistan's income distribution is unbalanced. The Gini coefficient, which measures income
inequality, was 0.41 in 2021. A Gini number of 0 denotes perfect equality, while a Gini
coefficient of 1 indicates the greatest degree of inequality.

**Income Distribution:**
The richest 20% of people make up more than 50% of the nation's total income, while the
poorest 20% make up less than 5%. Over time, the rich have gotten richer and the poor have
gotten poorer, widening the income gap.

**Urban-Rural Divide:**
Pakistan has a discernible income disparity between urban and rural areas. Because there
are more job opportunities, resources, and social services available in urban areas, the average
income there is significantly higher than it is in rural areas.

**Education and Income:**
In Pakistan, a person's salary is mostly determined by their level of education. Higher
education is typically associated with better paying jobs and more stable income. For those who
are economically disadvantaged, illiteracy and a lack of quality education worsen income
disparity.

**Gender Wage Gap:**
In Pakistan, women make significantly less money than males, which contributes to
wealth disparity. Cultural traditions, women's lower labor market participation rates, and
occupational segregation all contribute to the gender wage gap.

**ï‚· Data:**
The dataset used for this research is taken from the World Income Inequality Database
(WIID). The World Income Inequality Database (WIID) presents information on income
inequality for developed, developing, and transition countries. It provides the most
comprehensive set of income inequality statistics available.
